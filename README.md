## AR-Photobooth

- These files needs to be on a server, may be localhost.
- In `index.html`, I've only eliminated the use of `compatibility.js` and `smoother.js`.
- `jquery.js`, `jquery.objectdetect.js` are not being used here.
- `example.html` is the [original example](https://github.com/mtschirs/js-objectdetect/blob/master/examples/example_sunglasses.htm) provided with the [library](https://github.com/mtschirs/js-objectdetect).
